# Task Backlog

Status: authoritative executable task backlog.

This file is intentionally compact. It should contain only the active TB queue,
the task template, and deferred non-goals. Detailed maturity framing lives in
`docs/current_maturity_snapshot.md`; completed TB history lives in
`docs/agent_work_log.md`.

Worker rule: when a task is completed and committed, remove it from this file.
Append completed TB work to the bottom of `docs/agent_work_log.md` using that
file's template. Record durable decisions in `docs/decision_log.md`.
Inspect first entries must resolve to tracked repository files unless explicitly marked `external:` or `generated scratch:`.

Progress rule: each task should produce executable or measured progress, not
only labels, validators, or roadmap/status churn.

Orchestrator rule: execute active tasks sequentially by numeric order. Launch
one worker, verify clean `main` and task removal after it finishes, then continue
to the next task. Stop on any failure or dirty worktree; do not pre-generate
later prompts. Full sequential-loop guidance lives in
`docs/orchestration_strategy.md`.

## Active Tasks

### TB-221: Observed Runout And Deposition Acquisition Blocker Matrix

Goal: Convert the physical-evidence intake gap into a concrete acquisition blocker matrix for observed runout/deposition, release-zone provenance, block-population evidence, calibration inputs, validation inputs, and holdout data.

Capability gap reduced: Physical credibility remains `not_established` partly because missing evidence categories are named, but not yet organized into an actionable acquisition and acceptance matrix.

Why this outranks alternatives: The reviewer identified independent physical evidence as the highest scientific priority; a precise blocker matrix prevents more workflow packaging from masquerading as progress.

Inspect first:

- `scripts/summarize_observed_runout_deposition_intake_contract.py`
- `scripts/map_physical_credibility_evidence_requirements.py`
- `scripts/assess_validation_calibration_evidence_gaps.py`
- `docs/target_area_physical_evidence_acquisition_pack.md`
- `docs/validation_data_schema.md`
- `docs/current_maturity_snapshot.md`

Deliverables:

- A machine-readable acquisition matrix with required fields, acceptable provenance, uncertainty fields, licensing/readiness notes, calibration-versus-validation role, and holdout eligibility for each evidence category.
- A deterministic blocked report when no real observed runout/deposition package is available.
- Acceptance tests for complete fixture shape, missing geometry, missing uncertainty, unclear calibration role, and overclaiming blocked statuses.
- A short next-action recommendation that distinguishes data acquisition, schema repair, and scientific deferral.

Definition of done:

- A worker can tell exactly which physical evidence category is missing, what would make it acceptable, and why workflow reproducibility still does not establish physical credibility.

Boundaries: Acquisition planning and acceptance gate only; no calibration, no parameter fitting, no validation-status upgrade, no annual-frequency or risk semantics, and no operational claim.

## Backlog Protocol

Task headings must always be exactly:

```markdown
### TB-XXX: Short Description
```

Do not put priority, status, owner, or tags in the heading. Use this schema for
every active task:

```markdown
### TB-XXX: Short Description

Goal: One sentence describing why the task matters now.

Capability gap reduced: The concrete capability gap this task reduces.

Why this outranks alternatives: One sentence explaining why this is high
leverage now.

Inspect first:

- `path/or/script.py`

Deliverables:

- Concrete executable, analysis, test, or measured output.

Definition of done:

- Focused checks pass, the capability outcome is explicit, and the task is
  removed from this backlog only when the definition of done is genuinely met.

Boundaries: No tuning, operational claims, scale-up authorization, or other
phase changes unless the task explicitly allows them.
```

Workers should start with compact task context and a targeted backlog lookup:

```bash
PYENV_VERSION=system uv run python scripts/print_agent_task_context.py --task TB-xxx --format json
rg -n "^### TB-xxx:" docs/task_backlog.md
```

Read only the selected task and its `Inspect first` files unless the task
explicitly requires broader context. Use `--detail full` on the task-context
helper only for orchestrator/review work.

Keep worker prompts compact: include the selected task body and essential
pitfalls only. Redirect large JSON, diffs, and logs to `/tmp`, summarize the
result, preserve the final relevant error block when a command fails, and
finish with the compact structured report schema:
`TASK`, `STATUS`, `SUMMARY`, `FILES_CHANGED`, `CHECKS_RUN`, `COMMIT`,
`PUSH_STATUS`, `REMAINING_NEXT_TASK`, `BOUNDARY_NOTE`.

For `STATUS`, distinguish `implemented_measured`,
`implemented_fixture_backed`, `implemented_blocked_report`,
`blocked_unresolved`, and `partial_needs_followup` when relevant. A blocked
report or fixture-backed proof is not the same as measured execution; leave or
add the smallest unblock task before dependent synthesis work.

Before commit, run the task-specific checks, `git diff --check`, repository
consistency, `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, and the placeholder-artifact scan.

Do not keep completed tasks here. Use `agent_work_log.md` for chronological TB
execution history and `decision_log.md` for durable decisions.
